Anthropotrope
=============

Creating full colour, real time POV with Teensy3 and 5V LPD8806 RGB LED strips

We created a work in colaboration with Honda and the Sydney Festival 2013. The work was a large scale volumetric persistance of vision display. The result was an anthropotrop made from 24 led strips in three concentric circles around a spinning cup.
